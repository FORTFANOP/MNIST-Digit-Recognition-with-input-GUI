# MNIST-Digit-Recognition-with-input-GUI
A Neural Network model that classifies handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
This project includes a GUI(Graphical User Interface) made with Gradio.

## How to use?
Simply run the code on your machine (preferrably Google Colab) and draw a number between 0 and 9 in the input 
space. The predicted value will be shown in the side along with the accuracy.
